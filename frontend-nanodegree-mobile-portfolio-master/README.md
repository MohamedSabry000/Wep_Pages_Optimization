###optimize this online portfolio for speed:
 I optimized the critical rendering path and made this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques I've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

I moved all styles to be from external sheet to internal style inside index.html

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

I modified views/js/main.js until my frames per second rate is more than 60 fps. 
and to optimize images, I combressed the photoes used in the page
